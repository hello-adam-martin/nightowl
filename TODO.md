BUGS
- when an address is saved and then another address is entered, the saved address is still being applied. Need to remove the saved address when address is changed

MUST DO
- expand upon about page
- Use hooks/useStoreStatus.ts for the different places that is checking if store is open etc

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics
- move checkServicibility from home-page to be self contained in the addressForm ??



SAAS
1. set commission
2. set delivery zones for operator
3. think about how we can support different areas
    - delivery zones / prices
    - products associated with zones

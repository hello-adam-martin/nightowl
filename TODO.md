BUGS
- when an address is saved and then another address is entered, the saved address is still being applied. Need to remove the saved address when address is changed
- topbar opening hrs is overlapping the "learn more" button - I think we can just remove it on small screens

MUST DO
- expand upon about page
- mobile friendly categories

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics
- move checkServicibility from home-page to be self contained in the addressForm ??



SAAS
1. set commission
2. set delivery zones for operator
3. think about how we can support different areas
    - delivery zones / prices
    - products associated with zones

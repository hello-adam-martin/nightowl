BUGS
- when an address is saved and then another address is entered, the saved address is still being applied. Need to remove the saved address when address is changed

MUST DO
- expand upon about page
- link to delivery-address page


NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts

ENHANCEMENTS
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics
- Track top up amounts (in db)
- move checkServicibility from home-page to be self contained in the addressForm ??



SAAS
1. set commission
2. set delivery zones for operator
3. think about how we can support different areas
    - delivery zones / prices
    - products associated with zones

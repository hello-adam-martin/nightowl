BUGS
- Our countdown is slightly out - it is calculating 60 secs for the last minute rather than checking actual seconds remaining (not a biggie)

MUST DO
- Ensure phone number is valid
- expand upon about page
- need to remove a lot of the logic in home page to be encapsulated in the component itself.

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- Move Cart to layout - so we don't need to call on every page.
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics

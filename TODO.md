BUGS
- category display is not displaying the actual name... but rather the "key"
- AM / PM extra is showing in topbar when we are open
- Our countdown is slightly out - it is calculating 60 secs for the last minute rather than checking actual seconds remaining (not a biggie)

MUST DO
- expand upon about page
- Use hooks/useStoreStatus.ts for the different places that is checking if store is open etc

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics



SAAS
1. set commission
2. set delivery zones for operator
3. think about how we can support different areas
    - delivery zones / prices
    - products associated with zones

BUGS
- PRODUCTS ARE CACHED when nextjs build runs (i.e deployed on vercel)
- When doing a search - the search dissapears when text is entered that does not match any products
- Our countdown is slightly out - it is calculating 60 secs for the last minute rather than checking actual seconds remaining (not a biggie)
- If we display inentory change message along with top up message... then you can't see the items in the cart (no space)

NOTES

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- Integrate analytics

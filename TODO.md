BUGS
- When store closes, the cart is still allowing checkout for a minute or so after the store has closed. Also, need to display the time information with am / pm and display the time until open correctly.

MUST DO
- update the polygon with the new locations
- find a new name as NightOwl is not available
- register the domain
- setup email
- update contact details
- setup payment gateway to go live


NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

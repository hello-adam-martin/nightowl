BUGS
- Our countdown is slightly out - it is calculating 60 secs for the last minute rather than checking actual seconds remaining (not a biggie)

MUST DO
- expand upon about page
- need to remove a lot of the logic in home page to be encapsulated in the component itself.

NICE TO HAVE
- email receipts - ask for email address after placing order.

ENHANCEMENTS
- When checking address - can we put spinner on the button rather than loading the whole address component
- Integrate analytics
- change the placeholder image - maybe we can use the logo and greyscale it




SAAS
1. set commission
2. set delivery zones for operator
3. think about how we can support different areas
    - delivery zones / prices
    - products associated with zones
